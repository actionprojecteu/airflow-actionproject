# Zooniverse
1. When removing subjects sets from a workflow
	* It takes some time for the statitics to reflect that (5 min)
	* The dataset export still includes the subjects in inactive subject set

2. When a subject set is deleted
	* It still takes count against your maximun limit of datasets (10000)
	* The dataset export still includes the subjects in the deleted subject set

3. When you click on "Next" even without using the tools, this counts as "classified".

4. When you see the "ALREADY SEEN!" banner this means that all subject sets has been doisplayed to a user
- For test of retirement count == 1 this means deleting the subject sets and creating a new one
